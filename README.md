# Cybersecurity-project RELATED TO SANDBOX(SELF MADE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT FOR MALWARE ANALYSIS)
#SELF-MADE SETUP (SANDBOX)FOR MALWARE ANALYZER

#BASICALLY, WHEN I USED CUCKOO SANDBOX FEW YEARS BACK,I WAS AMAZED AT HOW IT DETECTED SUSPICIOUS FILES AND ANALYZED MALWARE
#THAT INSPIRED ME TO UNDERSTAND ITS WORKING AND HOW ITS MADE...THEREFORE I LEARNT LOTTA THINGS ON SETUP OF A SANDBOX

#BASICALLY AFTER A FEW YEARS OR LET ME TELL U THAT FEW MONTHS AGO (LOL) I STARTED ON MY SELF-MADE SANDBOX PROJECT
#I CAN'T DEMONSTRATE HERE MUCH(FOR OBVIOUS REASONS AS IT IS ON A VIRTUAL ENVN WHICH IS SUPPLID WITH A FAKE NET TOO)
#LET AIMAN EXPLAIN :P
#BASICALLY,I MADE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT WITH VIRTUAL BOX....SO TO DETECT A MALWARE WITH OLD GENERATION FEATURES IS VER EASY WITH
#A VIRAL ENVIRONMENT BUT NEW GENERATION HAS NEW TECH,WHICH ALSO GIVES THE EDGE FOR ATTACKERS,THEY ENABLE THE MODERN MALWARE TO 
#DETECT VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS(JEEZ!! NOW I KNOW THATS PRETTY SCARY RIGHT?) TO TACKLE THIS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE FIRST OF ALL TO 
#NOT USE A GUEST VERSION OF VIRTUALBOX/VMWARE OR WHATEVER VM UR USING ,OK? SO,WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE 2+GB/4+GB IN OUR
#RAM OF VM AS MALWARE GETS TO KNOW ITS VM IF ITS LESS THAN 1 GB USUALLY ACCORDING TO ME I MAY NOT BE ACCURATE AS IT DEPENDS ON
#TYPE OF THE MALWARE,BY THE WAY;THEN WE ISOLATE THE VM & DISCOONECT TO INTERNET CONNECTIVITY OF OURS,
#DONT WORRY I USED FAKENET TO STIMULATE SOME INTERNET CONNECTIVITY AND ACCPET OR SEE REQUETS WHICH MALWARE IS MAKING ,THIS IS 
#THE *KEY* STEP TO DETECT ACCORDING TO ME BASED ON THE MALACIOUS REQUESTS IT SENDS LOL
#SO,WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE SOME APPLICATIONS ALSO U KNOW?;) THE MODERN MALWARE IS DAMN CLEVER IF IT FINDS NO APPLICATIONS AVAILIBLE
#IN OUR VM,SO WE DOWNLOAD SOME 3RD PARTY APPS TO STIMULATE THESE(UR CHOICE ,I USED FAKENET FOR THAT TOO)

#THIS WAS THE EXPLAINATION OF MY SRTUP OF SELF MADE SANDBOX, AS OF KNOW (2023)THIS WAS MY LONGEST BUT WORTH IT PROJECT
#DO COMMENT ON HOW U LIKED MY IDEA TO DETECT THESE INSTEAD OF USING READY MADE SANDBOXES.....:D_
