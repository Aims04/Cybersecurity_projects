#AUTHOR:AIMAN SHARIFF
#OBSERVATION: I have noticed that my windows 10 defender didn't detect it and got bypassed
 

#Note:This is just for my educational purposes and I Aiman Shariff im not responsible for ny misuse of this code..

#WHY ?: This is to detect loopholes in antiviruses and help them configure the bugs/loopholes..

#The keystokes are recorded in the terminal when the file is running in background..

#ALSO THIS IS A PROTOTYPE AND NOT SOME ADVANCED KEYLOGGER, WHICH CANNOT BYPASS Advanced Antiviruses!

#This prototype will be further developed and ill be looking forward to add an email feature to it...

#Observation 2: I just noticed an updated windows 11 defender detects my file in 1 of 5 scans...
