#AUTHOR:AIMAN SHARIFF
#OBSERVATION :I NOTICED THAT MY WINDOWS 10 DEFENDER DID NOT DETECT THIS KEYLOGGER ON MY SYSTEM AND IT BASICALLY JUST RECORDED KEYSTROKES OF MINE, LOL! 
#NOTE:THIS IS JUST FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES,AS I HAVE PASSION IN CYBER SECURITY I HAVE JUST MADE THIS PROTOTYPE KEYLOGGER AS A POV FROM THE RED TEAM TO FIND LOOPHOLES IN DETECTION OF KEYLOGGER BY  ANTIVIRUS
#IM A STUDENT OF VVCE WHO JUST CREATED THIS FOR FUN THAT'S IT ,NOT FOR ANY MISUSE OF THIS CODE....
#THE KEYSTROKES ARE RECORDED IF THE FILE IS OPEN AND ITS SEEN IN THE TERMINAL,I LOOK FORWARD TO DEVELOP THIS BY STORING THESE KEYSTROKES AND EMAILING TO A PARTICULAR EMAIL
#ALSO THIS IS A PROTOTYPE AND NOT SOME ADVANCED KEYLOGGER, WHICH CANNOT BYPASS AVG,avast, etc.
