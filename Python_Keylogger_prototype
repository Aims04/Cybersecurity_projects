#AUTHOR:AIMAN SHARIFF
#OBSERVATION: I have noticed that my windows 10 defender didnt detect it and got bypassed
 
#NOTE:THIS IS JUST FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES,AS I HAVE PASSION IN CYBER SECURITY I HAVE JUST MADE THIS PROTOTYPE KEYLOGGER AS A POV FROM THE RED TEAM TO FIND LOOPHOLES IN DETECTION OF KEYLOGGER BY  ANTIVIRUS


#The keystokes are recorded in the terminal when the file is running in background..

#ALSO THIS IS A PROTOTYPE AND NOT SOME ADVANCED KEYLOGGER, WHICH CANNOT BYPASS Advanced Antiviruses!

#This prototype will be further developed and ill be looking forward to add an email feature to it...

#Observation 2: I just noticed an updated windows 11 defender detects my file in 1 of 5 scans...
